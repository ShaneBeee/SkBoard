**SkBoard** is a simple, non-flickering scoreboard.   
It's the easiest Skript scoreboard addon you will EVER use! I mean it. NO.... seriously!

Things You Can Do:
- Set the title of your scoreboard (well, I should hope so)
- Set/delete lines on the scoreboard (without this, your scoreboard would be pretty boring)
- Clear a scoreboard (Cause sometimes, you just don't want or need one)
- Toggle a scoreboard (SAY WHATT??? Yep, thats right, you can easily toggle a board on or off)
- Check if a scoreboard is on (I mean... thats pretty cool)

Thats it... I told you it was that simple!
The syntaxes seriously couldn't not be any easier.
